BTP:

-----------------------

TODO:
1. Check elem by elem comparison with btp_python old
2. Add check that candidate was alrady added in handle_empty_marg,
cur_check not good enough for initial g_c=0
3. Add iterator for getting data for tf instead of the old data loader


14-03
ERRORS:
1. alpha was C instead of 0 while calling from handle_empty_rem
2. Gamma_c in the calculation of R whlie addition of new data point needs to be recalulcated
wrt to beta_c of the point to be added 










-----------------------
PROBS:
1. frame error - None control dep
2. WHILE loop not getting executed again - some recomp problem - read carefully - loop_var namedtuple
3. Now error of while loop vars not being able to participate in any operations - cause - None control dep

Reproduce and fix 2


ERRORS:
1. control dependency -- None is causing the error of whlie loop tensors cant be used in any
operation
2.
------------------------------- PIVOT ---------------------------

--------PYTORCH--------
1. Broadcasting
2. CUDA - automatic synchronization - new operator to create tensor in the same 
dtype = torch.cuda.FloatTensor
for cuda, use dataparallel instead of multiprocessing
3. map function
